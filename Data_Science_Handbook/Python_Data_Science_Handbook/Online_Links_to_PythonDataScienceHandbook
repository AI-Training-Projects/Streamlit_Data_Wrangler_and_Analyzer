A very interesting thing about this book is the relatively simple Python utilties that Jake Vanderplas used to create this publication and website directly from Jupyter Notebooks.  

The PDF and final paper published edition was created directly from the Juptyer Notebook content almost verbatim, except for the Table of Content and other publication house front matter.
